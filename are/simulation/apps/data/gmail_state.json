I am writing on behalf of Bärenreiter Verlag to propose a collaboration on a new critical commentary to accompany our forthcoming scholarly edition of Johannes Brahms's Symphony No. 3 in F major. Given your published work and long-standing expertise in Brahms studies and the development of the symphonic form, we would be honoured if you would serve as the principal author of the commentary.\n\nOutline of the proposed project:\n- Scope: A full critical commentary addressing sources, variant readings, performance-practice considerations, and a concise historical-context introduction (target length: 40,000–60,000 words).\n- Deliverables: manuscript of commentary (word-processed), critical apparatus referencing extant sources, recommended performance notes, and up to 8 musical examples (engraved or clear scans) where necessary.\n- Timeline: first draft of commentary within 6–8 months of contract signature; final revisions and proofs within 3 months thereafter.\n- Compensation: honorarium and schedule to be discussed; Bärenreiter offers standard scholarly-editorial terms and reimbursement for reasonable research-related expenses.\n\nIf you are interested, I would like to arrange a short meeting (video or phone) to discuss scope, editorial requirements, and a draft contract. Please let me know your availability over the next two weeks and any preliminary questions you may have.\n\nThank you for considering this invitation. I look forward to your response.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nDr. Anna‑Lena Köhler\nSenior Editor, Scholarly Editions\nBärenreiter Verlag\nanna-lena.koehler@baerenreiter.de",

I am very interested in contributing the critical commentary for your Brahms Symphony No. 3 edition. The proposed scope aligns well with my current research, and I welcome the opportunity to treat source criticism, variant readings, and performance-practice issues in a single, integrated commentary.\n\nA few preliminary points and questions:\n1) Concerning sources: I can prepare a full apparatus based on the primary manuscript sources and the first editions. Would Bärenreiter expect inclusion of relevant contemporary reviews and correspondence in the commentary proper, or should contextual materials be limited to a short introduction?\n2) Musical examples: please confirm preferred format (final engraved examples versus high-resolution scans of my own markings) and any engraving standards Bärenreiter requires.\n3) Timeline and obligations: I am available to begin work in July. I would appreciate a draft of the contract and a proposed schedule for interim deliverables.\n\nI am available for a video call the week of 16 June between 10:00 and 15:00 CET, or the following week in the mornings. Please let me know which time suits you and I will confirm.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDr. Matthias H. Bergmann\nProfessor of Musicology\nmatthias.bergmann@brahms-studies.org",

We will include a clause covering permissions for musical examples and any third-party source reproductions.\n- Proofs and revisions:\n  • Two rounds of contractual revisions are included; further rounds will be subject to additional compensation.\n\nPlease confirm whether these terms are acceptable in principle. If so, I will send the full written contract and our editorial style guide. Regarding musical examples: if you can provide engraved files, that expedites production; if not, scans are acceptable and we will arrange engraving at our cost against prior approval.\n\nI am available for a video call on 2025-06-16 at 10:30 CET if that still suits you.

I write to propose a scholarly collaboration in support of an upcoming Gewandhaus performance of Johannes Brahms's Symphony No. 3. As a specialist in Brahms and the development of the symphonic form, I would be pleased to contribute the following services to enhance the artistic and educational impact of the concerts:\n\n- A pre-concert lecture (c. 40–50 minutes, including 10–15 minutes for questions) to be presented on the afternoon/evening prior to the performance or as scheduled by the orchestra.\n- A concise on-stage preface (10–15 minutes) immediately before the performance to orient audiences to the symphony’s structure and expressive aims.\n- A substantive program note (approx. 1,200–1,800 words) focused on the work’s formal design, thematic rhetoric, and period performance considerations.\n- One rehearsal consultation (up to 90 minutes) in which I can discuss interpretive issues with the conductor and section principals; additional rehearsal presence can be arranged if desired.\n\nPreliminary timeline and deliverables:\n- Draft program note submitted for review by mid-September; final version by mid-October (adjustable to the orchestra’s schedule).\n- Lecture and on-stage preface coordinated with your programming and rehearsal plan.\n\nIf you are interested, I would welcome a brief meeting (in person or by video) to align expectations, confirm exact dates, and discuss a fee structure and the Gewandhaus’s contractual/payment procedures. Please let me know your availability in June or early July for a 30–45 minute call.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to the possibility of supporting the Gewandhaus in presenting Brahms’s Third Symphony.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nDr. Matthias H.

I am writing to propose a collaborative project between the Brahms Studies Centre and the European Music Archives Network to produce a scholarly digital edition and linked-data resource focused on Johannes Brahms's Symphony No. 3. The aim is to combine source images, diplomatic/critical TEI transcriptions, annotation layers (harmonic, motivic, and reception history), and interoperable metadata (IIIF manifests + EDM/EDM-Lite or Music-specific profiles) to support both musicological research and public access.\n\nProposed high-level deliverables:\n- High-resolution IIIF image manifests for principal manuscript sources and early editions.\n- TEI-encoded transcriptions with editorial apparatus and normative critical commentary.\n- RDF/JSON-LD linked-data exposing relations between sources, performances, and commentary (aligned to existing EMAN profiles where possible).\n- A small demonstrator web client that layers annotations and linked-data queries for exploratory research.\n- Documentation and a machine-readable metadata profile suitable for reuse across EMAN partners.\n\nPreliminary timeline (subject to discussion): 12 months, divided into discovery (2 months), digitisation & encoding (6 months), integration & demonstrator (3 months), dissemination & documentation (1 month). Estimated core-team roles: PI/musicology (me), digital scholarship lead (EMAN), TEI editor(s), developer(s), and rights/metadata officer.\n\nI would welcome EMAN's perspective on scope, metadata profile alignment, and technical workflows. If this appears of mutual interest, may we schedule a 60-minute meeting to discuss scope, resources, and potential funding avenues (e.g., Horizon Europe, private foundations)? I am available the week of 16 June and can circulate a brief draft work plan prior to the meeting.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal.

EMAN is very interested in the concept of a focused demonstrator combining IIIF, TEI and linked data for a canonical work such as Brahms's Symphony No. 3.

      "body": "Dear Dr. Márquez,\n\nThank you for your prompt and helpful reply. Please find brief answers to your questions below:\n\n1) Sources: My immediate proposal is to include the principal autograph score of Symphony No. 3 (Hamburg Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek, manuscript A), the surviving sketchbook pages held in the Brahms Archive, and the first edition plates. High-resolution images for the Hamburg manuscript are available but would require formal permission for reuse; some sketch images will require digitisation. I can provide a prioritized source list ahead of the meeting.\n\n2) Metadata/profile: I suggest aligning with EMAN's existing profiles where possible. For the pilot, TEI for encoding and IIIF for image delivery are preferred. For the bibliographic/archival layer, EDM with extensions for musical works (or a lightweight crosswalk to Music Ontology) would be suitable. I am open to EMAN recommendations about controlled vocabularies for persons, places, and work identifiers (VIAF, ISNI, RIdE/Work IDs if available).\n\n3) Licensing: My preference is to make transcriptions and RDF under a permissive scholarly licence (CC BY). Image licences will depend on source institutions; for demonstrator purposes we should aim for open access where possible, with clearly stated rights metadata for restricted items. I will begin rights-clearance enquiries immediately.\n\n4) Hosting: For sustainability, I propose a hybrid approach: EMAN can host the demonstrator and the integrated RDF index for discovery, while partner institutions retain canonical IIIF manifests on their platforms. We should formalise an API/harvest workflow for synchronization.\n\nRegarding meeting slots, 19 June 14:00–15:00 CEST works well for me. Please include any technical and metadata specialists you think relevant. I will circulate a one-page draft work plan and a sample TEI/IIIF snippet by 17 June so participants can prepare.\n\nI look forward to our discussion.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Matthias H.

I will invite our TEI editor (Dr. Lena Fischer) and our archive's rights officer (Markus Heller) to join the meeting. I will also circulate the one-page work plan, a short prioritized source list with current rights notes, and a TEI/IIIF snippet by close of day on 17 June.\n\nPreliminary action items from my side:\n- Deliver by 2025-06-17: one-page work plan; prioritized source list with current rights status; TEI-encoded example (sample passage) and IIIF manifest reference.\n- Prepare brief note on potential funding calls and budget outline to discuss at the meeting.\n\nOn licensing, to be explicit: I propose transcriptions and RDF be released under CC BY 4.0. Image licensing will be negotiated with holding institutions; where open licences cannot be obtained for the pilot, we will include derivative TEI and metadata under CC BY while using low-resolution preview images for the demonstrator and noting rights restrictions in the manifest.\n\nIf this approach is acceptable to EMAN, I will include it in the materials to circulate. Please advise if EMAN has any constraints regarding demonstrator images or preferred rights statements for metadata in the pilot.\n\nI look forward to speaking on 19 June at 14:00 CEST.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nDr. Matthias H.

Danke, die Lehre hält mich momentan wirklich auf Trab, aber zum Glück ist das Büroklavier noch intakt und die Kaffeemaschine hat gestern tatsächlich nicht gestreikt. Deine Gartenmeldung klingt wunderbar — du musst mir unbedingt Fotos schicken.\n\nSonntag um 11:00 im Café an der Markthalle passt mir bestens. Ich bringe ein paar Notenblätter mit (ich habe gerade ein interessantes Fragment von Brahms entdeckt, das ich dir zeigen möchte) und eine Aufnahme, die mir für den Frühsommer sehr warm und leicht vorkommt — vielleicht die Klaviertrios, Aufnahme von 1998, weißt du die? \n\nÜbrigens: nächsten Monat halte ich einen kleinen Vortrag über Brahms' Salonstücke; wenn du magst, lade ich dich ein. Kein offizieller Eintritt, einfach ein Freundinnen- und Freundetreffen danach.\n\nBis Sonntag dann — freue mich!\n\nHerzliche Grüße\nMatthias",

Kreuzberg is a lovely area for walks and coffee (and much better unpacking morale than my office, I suspect).\n\nI'm in Leipzig this week for a small symposium on chamber music and editions of late Brahms songs, so it's been full-on, but I should be back by Friday evening. Saturday would actually be perfect: there's a small chamber concert at the Mendelssohn-Haus that I was intending to attend — a program of early Brahms and Schumann. If you like, come along and we can meet beforehand for coffee. I'll book two tickets; the venue is intimate, so seats are limited.\n\nAs for work, the symposium sparked a useful line on alternative readings in the piano parts — nothing publishable yet but promising. Outside of that, I've taken to walking the old city parks at dusk; helps to reset.\n\nBring any unpacking war stories and tell me about the new neighbourhood. What have you been up to besides moving? New job or projects?\n\nBest,\nMatthias",

He's friendly and quiet in concert settings, but I wanted to check if that'd be OK. If the venue is really tiny and you prefer just the two of us, no problem — I can come solo.\n\nSince unpacking is still ongoing, I've been spending evenings fixing shelves and trying not to buy another plant (no promises). Also picked up cycling again — it's been great for clearing the mind and avoiding U-Bahn crowds.\n\nWhat time shall we meet, and where? And any dress code?

I'm finishing a small book on Brahms's chamber works and I'm back in Leipzig for a few weeks of archival work. My partner and I moved to a slightly larger flat, which finally allows for a piano again — small victories.\n\nAre you around next weekend for a coffee? I'd love to hear what you're working on these days and, if you have a little time, show you a couple of draft pages. If weekends aren't good, I'm flexible for an afternoon at the department instead.\n\nBest,\nMatthias",

I'd like to schedule a short meeting next week to review progress on the critical edition of Brahms's Symphony No. 3 and to agree on priorities for the commentary and variant apparatus. In particular I would like us to focus on the orchestration variants in the second movement and the suggested readings for the closing measures of the third movement.\n\nWould you be available on either Wednesday 2025-10-01 between 14:00–15:30 CET or Thursday 2025-10-02 between 09:00–10:00 CET? If neither works please propose two alternative slots.\n\nCould you also prepare a brief one-page summary of the variant readings you consider most significant (sources collated, recommended reading, and any unresolved issues) for movements II and III and upload it to the shared drive before the meeting? We have an internal deadline for the commentary draft on 2025-10-15 because we plan to circulate material to the publisher by the end of October.\n\nFinally: I have a high-resolution scan of the autograph horn/strings passages that might be relevant — I can bring that to the meeting or upload it if you'd prefer.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Matthias H.

I will circulate a Zoom link for those joining remotely.\n\nI will prepare and send the following by Wednesday evening (4 June):\n- A short draft of the outreach plan (program notes, one-page lecture outline)\n- A rehearsal recording from last week's session (audio link)\n- A list of participating players and brief notes on problematic passages they reported\n\nNoted on movements II and IV — I will highlight the rehearsal timestamps corresponding to the disputed bars so you can listen before the meeting. If you could bring the variant spreadsheet on Tuesday as you proposed, that will let us compile a combined list and assign items for editorial decisions versus performance practice recommendations.\n\nIf anything changes, please let me know. Otherwise I will book Seminarraum 3 and send calendar invites to the small working group.\n\nBest,\n\nMarkus",

I would like your advice and support on the following points:\n\n- Preferred encoding workflow for the editorial text (TEI) and the musical score (MEI) so we can link variants to bar numbers.\n- Feasibility of aligning the modern performance recording to the MEI score at bar/measure level for an interactive web view.\n- A short meeting (30–45 min) next week to scope tasks and milestones — I am available Tue/Wed afternoon (CET).\n\nTentative priorities: prepare MEI for the critical score, encode the critical apparatus in TEI, produce a first pass of alignment for testing, and create a small prototype viewer.\n\nCould you let me know your availability and any initial technical constraints you foresee? If helpful, I can prepare the source materials (diplomatic readings, collations, and a high-resolution recording) in a shared folder before our meeting.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMatthias\nDr. Matthias H.

      "body": "Dear Matthias,\n\nThanks for the clear brief — this sounds like a great project. A couple of quick points from the Digital Editions Lab side before the meeting:\n\n- TEI + MEI is the standard approach and works well: TEI for the apparatus and commentary, MEI for the score encoding. We can use element linking (TEI <ptr> / MEI @xml:id) to connect variants to measures.\n- For audio alignment, we can do a time-stamped alignment at the granularity of measures using either a simple JSON mapping (measure -> start/end time) or an ELAN/IIIF approach if you want annotations that are shareable with other tools. The mapping depends on how precise you need playback jumps versus visual highlighting.\n- Do you already have any MusicXML or MEI files, or only scans/diplomatic transcriptions? Existing MusicXML would speed up the process.\n\nI can meet next week on:\n- Tue 2025-10-07, 14:00–15:00 CET or 15:30–16:30 CET\n- Wed 2025-10-08, 10:00–11:00 CET\n\nIf Tue 14:00 works, I will prepare a short prototype repo and an MEI template to review. Also: please confirm where you will place the source files (shared drive or our lab server) and whether there are any copyright/licensing constraints for the recording.\n\nBest,\n\nSofía\nMs. Sofía García\nResearch Programmer / Digital Editions Lab\nInstitute for Musicology, University of Leipzig",

I have uploaded the primary materials to our shared drive under /projects/brahms/symphony3/movement_III/:\n\n- movement_III_scores.zip (diplomatic transcriptions and editorial normalizations in MusicXML where available)\n- collations_table.xlsx (variant readings and sources)\n- recording_highres.wav (full movement, rights cleared for research use)\n- notes_for_encoding.pdf (my priorities for apparatus tagging and example citations)\n\nYour suggestion to use measure -> time JSON mapping sounds good for the prototype; if later we decide to export to ELAN/IIIF we can extend the mapping. For the editorial workflow I'd like the following priorities for the first delivery by 2025-10-31:\n1) MEI files for the edited score (basic encoding of measures and editorial sigla)\n2) TEI skeleton for the critical apparatus with pointers to MEI measure IDs\n3) A simple web prototype that highlights measures in sync with the recording (measure jumps + basic navigation)\n\nNo special licensing beyond standard University research use — but please note that the recording cannot be published publicly without further clearance; for the prototype we can host on the lab's internal test server.\n\nI'll bring a short list of contentious readings to the meeting so we can decide encoding conventions.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMatthias",

I confirm the meeting today, Tue 2025-10-07 at 14:00 CET (Teams link in calendar invite).\n\nPre-meeting actions from my side:\n- I will set up a private Git repository in the lab (brahms-symphony3-mvIII) and add MEI/TEI templates.\n- Prepare a minimal measure->time JSON using the recording for demonstration.\n- Draft a short checklist for the encoding conventions (variant tagging, use of <app> in TEI, MEI @xml:id scheme).\n- Provision a test instance on our internal server where the prototype will run (not public).\n\nQuestions for the meeting:\n1) Preferred XML namespace versions for TEI/MEI you want us to target? We usually use TEI P5 and MEI 4, but we can adapt.\n2) Do you want editorial sigla expanded inline or kept as abbreviations in the apparatus?\n3) Any particular metadata schema for the repository (Dublin Core, MODS)?\n\nNext milestone: I propose a short status check on 2025-10-30 to review the MEI files and the prototype. If that works for you, I'll block 30 minutes in your calendar.\n\nSee you at 14:00.\n\nBest,\n\nSofía",
